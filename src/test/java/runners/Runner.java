/*
When you run Runner, it will go to feature file, and start execution from top to bottom.
If there is any step matching, Java will find that matching 'stepdefinition', and it will be executed.
If there is no match then Cucumber will generate template for us in the console.

/*
features = "./src/test/resources/features",   // Path of Features folder
glue = "stepdefinitions" ,  // PATH OF STEP DEFINITIONS folder or just the name coz all this package is at the same level as runners package
dryRun = false    //If true that means RUN DRY => give me the missing stepdefinition without running all the previous steps OR the whole test case.
                  // To run the test case, we have to make dryRun=false (default) otherwise it won't run the test case.


  Cucumber HTML Reports

We need to add reports plug in the Runner to get the reports.
We can get html, json, or junit reports
For testers, html reports are the most important  (open in browsers)
We also add Maven reporting plugins for reports
Change the name before running, otherwise it will be overrun e.g. "html:target/default-cucumber-reports2.html", .. add name/number after "cucumber-reports"

DATA TABLES
> are used to pass test data (multiple data)
> Data Tables are similar to scenario_outline but a bit more difficult as it requires more Java codes
> DIFFERENCES
> No "Examples" keyword in DATA TABLES
> DATA TABLES can be used at any step in the code, but Examples keyword is ONLY used at the end of the code
> In DATA TABLES, we use "Scenario" ONLY.
> DATA TABLES return tables object in the method, so we have to use Collections to use them in stepdefinitions
> Scenario outline returns String in the method, so easier to get and use.
> DATA TABLES are not as popular as Scenario Outline

HOOKS
> specific for Cucumber .. important one
> it is a class that runs Before and After each scenario
> import from Cucumber
> used to generate reports with screenshots
> AfterMethod is very helpful to capture screenshots when Scenario fails
> screenshot will be attached in html file

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:

What is  difference between Data driven and keyword driven framework and Hybrid framework?
DATA DRIVEN:
Testing the tests cases with multiple data. In Data driven testing, we sent multiple data and expect them to pass. If something fails, then dev fix and test with same data until all tests cases pass. Excel data, database data, xml data, scenario outline data,â€¦
KEYWORD DRIVEN:
The above categorization can be done and maintained with the help of Excel spread sheet:
Test Step: It is a very small description of the Test Step or the description of the Action going to perform on Test Object.
Test Object: It is the name of the Web Page object/element, like Username & Password.
Action: It is the name of the action, which is going to perform on any Object such as click, open browser, input etc.
Test Data: Data can be any value which is needed by the Object to perform any action, like Username value for Username field.
HYBRID FRAMEWORK
A framework that can do both Behavior Driven Testing and Data Driven Testing
Normally we used excel in Junit, excel in Test NG, excel in cucumber.
Ahmet works in Blue Car rental compony
Framework: Cucumber BDD framework
We mostly do BDD, but we can do TDD(Test Driven something) with cucumber using a)scenario outline b) excel
